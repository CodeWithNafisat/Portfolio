## 🔹 Projects

### 1. [Sentiment Analysis App](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/Sentiment-Analysis-App)

**Built a deployed NLP system that classifies customer feedback in real time, helping businesses understand user satisfaction and prioritize improvements.**

**Problem Solved:** Understanding customer sentiment at scale to reduce reputational risk.

* **The Problem:** Organizations receive massive amounts of text feedback (reviews, ratings, social media comments). Manual analysis is impractical and delays response to negative trends.
* **The Solution:** This app automates sentiment analysis, allowing real-time and batch processing to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Technical Highlights:**

* NLP pipeline with **TF-IDF vectorization**.
* **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** classifiers.
* **Supports single review analysis and bulk CSV uploads.**
* **Accuracy:** 88% (both SVM and Logistic Regression)
* **Decision Impact:** Enables proactive intervention in customer service and brand management, reducing operational and reputational risk.

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, NLP, Streamlit

### 2. [Spam Detection App](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/SpamDetection)

**Designed a spam detection model using NLP and supervised learning to protect users from unwanted messages, achieving strong precision-recall balance on imbalanced data.**

**Problem Solved:** Filtering harmful or irrelevant messages to protect communication channels.

* **The Problem:** Spam and phishing messages waste time and create operational risk.
* **The Solution:** The app detects and separates spam from legitimate messages, reducing exposure to threats.

**Technical Highlights:**

* Feature engineering using **TF-IDF**.
* **Logistic Regression** classifier optimized for accuracy.
* **Accuracy:** 96%
* **Decision Impact:** Safeguards organizational communication, minimizes cybersecurity risk, and reduces manual moderation workload.

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, NLP

### 3. [Profit Forecasting Dashboard](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/Profit-Forecasting-) ([Live App](https://jgebuwvu2exanggkxrrebs.streamlit.app/))

**Developed a time-series forecasting dashboard that enables non-technical stakeholders to make data-driven business planning decisions.**

**Problem Solved:** Enabling accurate financial planning and reducing operational uncertainty.

* **The Problem:** Managers need reliable forecasts to make decisions on inventory, staffing, and sales goals, but complex data analysis is often inaccessible.
* **The Solution:** Forecasts future profits using historical sales data with interactive visualizations for actionable insights.

**Technical Highlights:**

* Time-series forecasting using **Prophet**.
* Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** to display forecast trends and variance.
* **Accuracy (forecast reliability):** MAE = 76,741; MAPE = 11.7%
* **Decision Impact:** Supports inventory management, budgeting, and revenue planning, reducing financial and operational risk.

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Prophet, Streamlit

### 4. [Intelligent Crop Recommendation System](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/cropselectionprediction)

**Built an explainable ML system that recommends optimal crops based on soil and climate data, improving transparency through SHAP-based model explanations**

**Problem Solved:** Reducing agricultural risk and improving resource utilization.

**The Problem:** Choosing the wrong crop can lead to low yields, financial loss, and inefficient use of resources.

**The Solution:** An AI-driven system recommends the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, with **interpretable explanations**.

### **Technical Highlights**

* **Feed-Forward Neural Network** in PyTorch for crop classification.
* **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard** for user input and instant recommendations.
* **Explainable AI:** SHAP visualizations highlight key influencing factors.
* **Accuracy:** 99%
* **Decision Impact:** Guides farmers in selecting high-yield crops, preventing financial loss, and ensuring sustainable resource management.

**Technologies Used:** Python, PyTorch, Streamlit, SHAP, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
