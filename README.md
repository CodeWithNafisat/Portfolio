# 📂 Portfolio – Abdulraheem Nafisat

Welcome This repository showcases my **top AI and Machine Learning projects**, highlighting both the technical solutions and the real-world problems they solve.  


## 🔹 Projects

### 1. [Sentiment Analysis App](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/Sentiment-Analysis-App)
**Problem Solved:** Understanding customer opinions at scale.  
- **The Problem:** Businesses, organizations, and creators get massive amounts of text feedback (like movie reviews, product ratings, or social media comments). It's impossible for a human to read every single one to understand if people are happy or upset.  
- **The Solution:** This app automates the process. Users can instantly analyze text and get a "positive" or "negative" sentiment score, helping companies quickly gauge public opinion and identify trends or issues.  

**Technical Highlights:**  
- Full **text preprocessing pipeline**: tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization.  
- **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models.  
- Supports **single review input** and **bulk CSV uploads**.  
- **Confidence scores** for prediction reliability.  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, NLP, Streamlit

### 2. [Spam Detection App](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/SpamDetection)
**Problem Solved:** Protecting users from unwanted and harmful content.  
- **The Problem:** Spam messages waste time, clog inboxes, and can be dangerous, containing viruses, scams, or phishing attempts.  
- **The Solution:** This app intelligently identifies and separates spam from legitimate messages, keeping inboxes clean, saving time, and reducing risk.  

**Technical Highlights:**  
- Feature engineering using **TF-IDF** and NLP techniques.  
- Evaluated with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, NLP

### 3. [Profit Forecasting Dashboard](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/Profit-Forecasting-)
**Problem Solved:** Making strategic business planning accessible.  
- **The Problem:** Managers need to make critical decisions like inventory, hiring, and sales goals, but deep data analysis is often too complex for non-technical users.  
- **The Solution:** This dashboard forecasts future profits using past sales data and provides **interactive visualizations** for non-technical users to understand trends, seasonality, and make data-driven decisions.  

**Technical Highlights:**  
- Built using **Python, Pandas, Prophet** for time-series forecasting.  
- Designed **interactive visualizations** for accessibility.  
**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Prophet, Streamlit

### 4. [Intelligent Crop Recommendation System](https://github.com/CodeWithNafisat/CropSelectionPrediction) 🌾

**Problem Solved:** Helping farmers choose the best crop for their soil and climate.

* **The Problem:** Selecting the wrong crop can lead to low yields, financial loss, soil degradation, and inefficient resource use. Traditional methods often rely on intuition or generic guidelines.
* **The Solution:** This **AI-driven decision support tool** recommends the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. It also provides **interpretable explanations** for each recommendation.

**Technical Highlights:**

* **Deep Learning Core:** PyTorch Feed-Forward Neural Network for crop classification.
* **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** Users input soil and environmental data to get instant recommendations.
* **Explainable AI:** SHAP visualizations highlight which factors influenced the recommendation.
* **Smart UX:** “Reset” functionality ensures old inputs or predictions do not persist.

**Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn
